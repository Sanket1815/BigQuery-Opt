## 🎯 High-Impact Patterns (40%+ Improvement)

### 1. Approximate Aggregation
**Pattern ID**: `approximate_aggregation`
**Performance Impact**: 40-70% improvement
**Use Case**: Large datasets where exact counts aren't critical

**What it optimizes**:
```sql
-- Before (Slow on large datasets)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM large_orders;

-- After (Much faster)
SELECT APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(customer_id) FROM large_orders;
```

**When to apply**:
- `COUNT(DISTINCT column)` on tables with millions of rows
- Approximate results are acceptable for analytics
- Performance is more important than exact precision

**Documentation**: [Approximate Aggregate Functions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/approximate_aggregate_functions)

**Business Impact**: Enables real-time analytics on large datasets

---

### 2. Subquery to JOIN Conversion
**Pattern ID**: `subquery_to_join`
**Performance Impact**: 30-60% improvement
**Use Case**: Correlated subqueries and EXISTS clauses

**What it optimizes**:
```sql
-- Before (Correlated subquery - slow)
SELECT customer_name 
FROM customers c 
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o 
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id 
    AND o.status = 'completed'
);

-- After (JOIN - much faster)
SELECT DISTINCT c.customer_name
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.status = 'completed';
```

**When to apply**:
- `EXISTS` subqueries
- `IN (SELECT ...)` subqueries
- `NOT EXISTS` patterns
- Correlated subqueries in SELECT clause

**Documentation**: [JOIN Best Practices](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/best-practices-performance-compute#optimize_your_join_patterns)

    FROM customers c 
    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
) 
WHERE date >= '2024-01-01';

-- After (Filter applied early)
SELECT c.name, o.total, o.date

-- After (Using clustering keys first)
SELECT * FROM clustered_orders 
WHERE customer_id BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000  -- Clustering key
AND region = 'US-West' 
AND order_date >= '2024-01-01';
```

```sql
-- Before (No partitioning - processes all data)
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY order_date) as row_num
FROM orders;

-- After (Partitioned - processes data in chunks)
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) as row_num
FROM orders;
```

**When to apply**:

        WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 'low_value'
        ELSE 'other'
    END as order_category
FROM orders;

-- After (Optimized CASE structure)
SELECT 
    CASE

## 🎯 Pattern Selection Logic

### Automatic Pattern Detection

The system automatically detects applicable patterns based on:

1. **SQL Keywords**: `SELECT *`, `COUNT(DISTINCT`, `EXISTS`, `JOIN`
2. **Query Structure**: Number of tables, subqueries, functions
3. **Table Metadata**: Size, partitioning, clustering information
4. **Performance Characteristics**: Expected data volume, complexity

### Priority Scoring

Patterns are prioritized by:
1. **Expected Impact**: Higher improvement percentage = higher priority
2. **Query Complexity**: More complex queries get more aggressive optimization
3. **Table Size**: Larger tables benefit more from certain optimizations
4. **Business Context**: Critical queries get priority treatment

### Pattern Combinations

The system intelligently combines patterns:
- **Column Pruning + JOIN Reordering**: Reduce data before expensive JOINs
- **Subquery Conversion + Predicate Pushdown**: Convert then optimize filters
- **Approximate Aggregation + Window Optimization**: Fast analytics patterns
